# Quality Control {background-color="#cfb991"}


## Quality

The American Society for Quality (ASQ) defines quality as:

<br>

> “the characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs.”

<br>

- U.S. Organizations recognize that they must strive for high levels of quality (Car industry in 1980's).

- In addition to managerial philosophy, they have increased the emphasis on statistical methods for monitoring and maintaining quality.


## Total Quality

- **Total Quality (TQ)** is a people-focused management system that aims at continual increase in customer satisfaction at continually lower real cost.

    - TQ is a total system approach (not a separate work program) and an integral part of high-level strategy. TQ works horizontally across functions (Concurrent engineering).
    - TQ involves all employees, top to bottom, and extends backward and forward to include both the supply and customer chains.
    - TQ stresses learning and continuous improvement as keys to organizational success.
        - Learning -> Improve quality -> Increased productivity -> Lower cost -> Gain in market share -> Stay in business -> Responsibility to society.

# Quality Frameworks  {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Quality Frameworks: Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award

- Established in 1987 and given by the U.S. president to organizations that judged to be outstanding in:

    1. Leadership
    2. Strategy
    3. Customer measurement, analysis, and knowledge management
    4. Workforce
    5. Operations
    6. Results

- The first awards were presented in 1988.

- The Award is named for Malcolm Baldrige, who was U.S. Secretary of Commerce from 1981 to 1987.

- The U.S. Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) manages the Award.


## Quality Frameworks: ISO 9000 series

- A series of five standards published in 1987 by the International Organization for Standardization in Geneva, Switzerland.

- The standards describe the need for:

    - an effective quality system,
    - ensuring that measuring and testing equipment is calibrated regularly,
    - maintaining an adequate record-keeping system.

- ISO 9000 registration determines whether a company complies with its own quality system.

## Quality Frameworks: Six Sigma

- Emphasizes the importance of taking measurements on critical quality characteristics.

- Focuses more on the process **variation** than the process mean.

- **A process is a Six Sigma process if its mean is centered, and the distances between the mean and Upper and Lower Specifications are six times the process's standard deviation (σ).**

- Six sigma level of quality means that for every million opportunities, no more than **3.4** defects will occur if the process mean drifts or shifts slightly.

- The methodology created to reach this quality goal is referred to as [Six Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma).


## Quality Frameworks: Six Sigma

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/six_sigma.png")
```

:::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}

- Six Sigma aims for defects to be so minimal that only **3.4 per million** occur.

- The target is represented as a bell curve centered at the mean ($\mu$) with six standard deviations ($\sigma$) between the mean and the specification limits.

:::{.fragment}

$$
\text{Defective Rate} = \text{Total Tail Areas}
$$
$$
\text{Defective Rate} = \text{NORM.S.DIST(-6, TRUE) + {1 - NORM.S.DIST(6, TRUE)}} \approx 0
$$

- With Six Sigma, shifts in the process mean are accommodated.

    - A shift of 1.5$\sigma$ still maintains low defect rates.
    - This shift leads to a defect rate of approximately 3.4 per million produced.

::::
::::


## Quality Frameworks: Service Sector

- Quality control is critical in service businesses (e.g., law firms, hotels, airlines, restaurants, and banks).

- Focus on customer satisfaction and improving the customer experience.

- Services are often intangible, making customer satisfaction subjective and quality measurement challenging.

# Quality Terminology {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Quality Terminology

- **Quality assurance** refers to the entire system of policies, procedures, and guidelines established by an organization to achieve and maintain quality.

- Quality assurance consists of two functions:

    - **Quality engineering** - its objective is to include quality in the design of products and processes and to identify potential quality problems prior to production.
    - **Quality control** consists of making a series of inspections and measurements to determine whether quality standards are being met.


# Statistical Methods for Quality {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Statistical Methods for Quality

- Statistical Design of Experiments (DOEs): For process and product design.

    - One-factor ANOVA.
    - Factorial design, etc.

- **Statistical Process Control (SPC)**: Monitoring and controlling process for stability over time.

- **Acceptance Sampling**: Sorting products into conforming or nonconforming products, and lot sentencing.


# Statistical Process Control (SPC) {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Statistical Process Control (SPC)

- Critical process quality characteristic is inspected and measured.

    - There will always be variation in the unit-to-unit measurements.
    
    - Two types of causes of variation: **Common Causes** and **Assignable Causes**.
    
    - Common causes are allowed for the time being, but assignable causes need to be removed immediately.
    
    - Adjusting a process with only common cause variations will increase process variation. ([The Deming’s funnel experiment](https://deming.org/explore/the-funnel-experiment/).)

- The **goal** of SPC is to detect and eliminate the **assignable causes** as soon as possible, based on samples from the process **over time**.


## Statistical Process Control (SPC): Common Causes 

- Randomly occurring variations in materials, humidity, temperature, etc.

- Variation is natural and unexplained.

- Affecting **all** units/outputs.

- Variations the producer cannot control (in the short-term).

- Process is in **statistical control** and hence, does not need adjustment.

##  Statistical Process Control (SPC): Assignable Causes 

- Non-random and identifiable (significant) variations in output due to tools wearing out, operator error, incorrect machine settings of a few machines, poor quality raw material from certain vendors, etc.
- Affecting certain or **individual** outputs.
- Process is **out of control**, and the producer can and must control (immediately).
- **Corrective action** should be taken.


## Statistical Process Control (SPC): Applications

:::::: nonincremental

- Temperature of a die
- Weights of bags of potato chips of a filling process
- Weekly sales figures
- Customer complaints
- Product responses
- Inventory level
- Absenteeism
- Accidents
- Account receivables
- Process defective rate

::::::

## SPC vs. Hypothesis Testing

We use SPC to monitor and control the parameters (mean, variability, or proportion) of a process at each time and over time. Based on hypothesis-testing methodology, we have:
  
$$ 
H_0: \text{Process is in control } (\mu = \mu_0, \text{ or } R = R_0) 
$$

$$
H_a: \text{Process is out of control} 
$$

- The test statistic is the monitoring statistic in SPC: $\overline{x}$ for process mean, $\overline{p}$ for process proportion, etc.



## Statistical Process Control (SPC): Decisions and Errors

<br>

| Decision           | State of Production Process              |                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
|                    | **H<sub>0</sub> True Process in Control** | **H<sub>0</sub> False Process Out of Control** |
| **Continue Process** | Correct decision                       | Type II error (allowing an out-of-control process to continue) |
| **Adjust Process**   | Type I error (adjusting an in-control process) | Correct decision |

<br>

- Control the **Probability of a False Alarm** at $\alpha$ (the significance level).


##  Statistical Process Control (SPC): Control Charts

::: {style="font-size: 65%;"}

SPC uses graphical displays known as **control charts** to monitor a production process (mean, variability, or percent defectives).

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/x_bar_chart.png")
```

- The Center Line (CL) represents what the process parameter value should be when the process is in control (denoted by $\mu_0$ or $R_0$).

- The Upper Control Limit (UCL) and Lower Control Limit (LCL) are the two-sided **critical values** for the monitoring statistic.

    - They are chosen so that when the process is in control, there will be a high probability that the monitoring statistic value will be between the two lines.
    - They are chosen to allow common causes variation in the process and hence in the monitoring statistic.
    - Values outside of the control limits provide strong evidence that the process is out of control.

# Variables Control Charts

A variable control chart is used to monitor and control a process parameter over time if the process’ quality characteristic, $X$, is continuous or numeric; for example, the completion time of a task, weight of a bag, temperature of a die, etc.

- $\overline{X}$ Chart is used to monitor the process mean ($\mu$) of $X$. The monitoring statistic at time $j$ is the sample mean, $\overline{X}_j$.

- $R$ Chart is used to monitor the process range ($R$), a measure of variability. The monitoring statistic at time $j$ is the sample range, $R_j$.

# $\bar{X}$ Chart: Process Mean and Standard Deviation Known {background-color="#cfb991"}

## $\bar{X}$ Chart: Process Mean and Standard Deviation Known

**Example: KJW Packaging**

When KJW’s cereal carton filling process is in control, the weight of cartons of cereal filled by the process is normally distributed with a mean of 16.05 ounces and a standard deviation of 0.10 ounces.

- **Question:** What should be the control limits for $\bar{X}$ based on a sample of n = 10 observations?


## $\bar{X}$ Chart: Process Mean and Standard Deviation Known

Assume in-control process mean is $\mu_0$ and standard deviation is $\sigma$.

For each $\bar{X}_j$,

  $$
  \text{UCL} = \mu_0 + 3 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$
  
  $$
  \text{CL} = \mu_0
  $$
  
  $$
  \text{LCL} = \mu_0 - 3 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$

where $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ is the standard deviation of $\bar{X}_j$ with a sample size of n.

- 3 is the z-multiplier with 99.97% confidence level, or a false alarm rate of $\alpha = 0.27\%$.

## $\bar{X}$ Chart: Process Mean and Standard Deviation Known

**Example: KJW Packaging**

$$
\mu_0 = 16.05, \quad \sigma = 0.10, \quad n = 10
$$

$$
\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{0.10}{\sqrt{10}} = 0.032
$$
$$
\text{UCL} = 16.05 + 3(0.032) = 16.146
$$

$$
\text{CL} = 16.05
$$
$$
\text{LCL} = 16.05 - 3(0.032) = 15.954
$$

A sample mean based on $n$ observations outside the limits indicates the process mean is out of control.

## $\bar{X}$ Chart: Process Mean and Standard Deviation Known

**Example: KJW Packaging**

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/x_bar_cereal_filling_process.png")
```

- Note that the fifth sample shows there is strong evidence that the process is out of control. 

- It indicates that assignable causes of output variation are present and that underfilling is occurring.

# $\bar{X}$ Chart: Process Mean and Standard Deviation Unknown {background-color="#cfb991"}

## $\bar{X}$ Chart: Process Mean and Standard Deviation Unknown

- **Assume the in-control process mean and standard deviation are unknown.**
  
    - They need to be estimated from an in-control process.

## Factors for $\bar{X}$ Control Chart: Explanation

::: {style="font-size: 65%;"}

1. **n**: The sample size, or the number of observations within each subgroup.

2. **$d_2$**: A constant used to estimate the mean of the range ($\bar{R}$) when the sample size $n$ is known.

3. **$A_2$**: A constant for calculating control limits for the $\bar{X}$ (X-bar) chart:

::: {.fragment}

$$
   \text{UCL} = \bar{\bar{X}} + A_2 \bar{R}
$$
   
and
   
$$
   \text{LCL} = \bar{\bar{X}} - A_2 \bar{R}
$$

where $\bar{\bar{X}}$ is the mean of sample means, and $\bar{R}$ is the average range.

:::

4. **$d_3$**: A constant related to the standard deviation of the range distribution, useful for control limits on range charts.

5. **$D_3$**: Used for the Lower Control Limit (LCL) on the R-chart:

::: {.fragment}

$$
   \text{LCL} = D_3 \times \bar{R}
$$

For small sample sizes, $D_3$ is often zero, indicating no lower control limit.

:::

6. **$D_4$**: Used for the Upper Control Limit (UCL) on the R-chart:

::: {.fragment}

$$
   \text{UCL} = D_4 \times \bar{R}
$$

Adjusts the upper limit based on sample size, providing a threshold for large ranges.

## $\bar{X}$ Chart: Process Mean and Standard Deviation Unknown

- **In case the process is out-of-control for some samples, exclude these samples and re-calculate the CL, UCL, and LCL to re-check the process.**

- This approach applies to other types of control charts as well.

# $R$ Chart for Process Variability {background-color="#cfb991"}

## $R$ Chart for Process Variability 

- **Assume the in-control process mean and standard deviation are unknown.**

- Because the control limits for the $\bar{X}$ chart depend on the value of the average range ($\bar{R}$), these limits will not have much meaning unless the process range is in control.

- In practice, the $R$ chart is usually constructed before the $\bar{X}$ chart.

    - If the $R$ chart indicates that the process variability is in control, then the $\bar{R}$ is used when constructing the $\bar{X}$ chart.

- The plotting statistic is the Sample Range, $R_j$.

## $R$ Chart for Process Variability 

For each $R_j$,

$$
\text{UCL} = D_4 \bar{R}
$$

$$
\text{CL} = \bar{R}
$$

$$
\text{LCL} = D_3 \bar{R}
$$

where:

- $\bar{R}$ = average range

- $D_3, D_4$ = constants that depend on $n$; refer to the "Factors for Control Charts" table.

$$
\text{CL} = \bar{R} = 0.0253

# Attributes Control Charts {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Attributes Control Charts

An attributes control chart is used if the quality of the output is measured in terms of discrete/counting data such as the number of defective units ($X$) in a sample, etc.

- $X$ is assumed to follow a Binomial distribution with a defective rate (proportion of “success”), $p$. The expected value of $X$ is $np$.

- **$p$ Chart**: Used to monitor $p$. The monitoring statistic at time $j$ is the sample proportion $\overline{p_j}$.

- **$np$ Chart**: Used to monitor the expected number of defectives in a sample of size $n$, $np$. The monitoring statistic at time $j$ is $X_j$.


# $p$ Chart for Process Proportion  {background-color="#cfb991"}

## $p$ Chart for Process Proportion 

Assume the in-control process proportion is known as $p_0$.

For each $\bar{p}_j$,
$$
\text{UCL} = p_0 + 3\sigma_{\overline{p}}
$$

$$
\text{CL} = p_0
$$

$$
\text{LCL} = p_0 - 3\sigma_{\overline{p}}
$$

where 

$$

## $p$ Chart for Process Proportion 

Assume the in-control process proportion is **unknown**.

**Example**: Automated mail-sorting process.

The automated mail sorting process in a post office scans the zip codes on the letters and diverts them to the proper carrier route. Suppose a sample of 200 letters is selected each hour for 24 hours to establish control limits for a **p chart**, where $p$ is the proportion of incorrectly sorted letters.

# $np$ Chart for Expected Number of Defectives {background-color="#cfb991"}

## $np$ Chart for Expected Number of Defectives

An $np$ chart is a control chart developed for the number of defective items in a sample. In this case, $n$ is the sample size and $p$ is the probability of observing a **defective** item when the process is in control. 

For each $X_j$,
$$
UCL = np + 3\sqrt{np(1 - \overline{p})}
$$

$$
CL = np
$$

$$
LCL = np - 3\sqrt{np(1 - \overline{p})}
$$

assuming $np \geq 5$ and $n(1 - \overline{p}) \geq 5$.

**Note**: If computed LCL is negative, set LCL = 0.

## Interpretation of Control Charts

- The location and pattern of points in a control chart enable us to determine, with a small probability of error, whether a process is in statistical control.

- A primary indication that a process may be out of control is a **data point outside the control limits**.

- Certain patterns of points within the control limits can be warning signals of quality problems (**Nelson’s 8 rules**):

    - A large number of points on one side of the center line (9 points).
    - Six or seven points in a row that indicate either an increasing or decreasing trend.

# Acceptance Sampling {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Acceptance Sampling

- **Acceptance sampling** is a statistical method that enables us to base the accept-reject decision on the results of inspection of a sample of items from the lot.

- The items of interest can be incoming shipments of raw materials or purchased parts as well as finished goods from final assembly (End-of-line inspection).

- Acceptance sampling has advantages over 100% inspection including:

    - Usually less expensive.
    - Less product damage due to less handling.
    - Fewer inspectors required.
    - Provides the only approach possible if destructive testing must be used.

## Acceptance Sampling: Example KALI, Inc.

KALI, Inc. manufactures home appliances that are marketed under a variety of trade names. It uses acceptance sampling plan to monitor the quality of overload protectors. Suppose a sample of 15 items is selected from each incoming shipment or lot and the policy is to accept a lot if at most one defective item is found in the sample.

<br>

Find the probability of accepting the lot when the defective rate of the incoming lot is 5%.

## Acceptance Sampling: Example KALI, Inc.

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}

A **simple lot acceptance sampling plan** is determined by $(n, c)$, where $n$ is the sample size, and $c$ is the **acceptance number** such that if the number of defectives in the sample is less than or equal to $c$ (i.e., $X \leq c$), the entire lot is accepted.

$$
n = 15, \quad c = 1.
$$

When the defective rate of the incoming lot is 5%, $p = 0.05$, the probability of accepting the lot is:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(\text{Accept Lot}) & = P(X \leq 1) = f(0) + f(1)\\
& = \frac{15!}{0!(15 - 0)!} \cdot 0.05^0 (1 - 0.05)^{15 - 0} + \frac{15!}{1!(15 - 1)!} \cdot 0.05^1 (1 - 0.05)^{15 - 1}\\
& = 0.4633 + 0.3658 \\
& = 0.8290
\end{align*}
$$

For its turn, the the probability of rejecting the lot is:

$$
P(\text{Reject Lot}) = 1 - 0.8290 = 0.1710
$$

\alpha = \text{The Producer's Risk: }\text{the probability that a lot with defective rate $p_0$ will be rejected} \\

## Selecting an Acceptance Sampling Plan: Example KALI, Inc.

A simple sampling plan with $(n, c)$ is selected when it comes close to meeting both the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ requirements specified.

**Example**: For the purpose of illustration, suppose we **require**:

- If $p_0 = 0.03$, $\alpha = \Pr(\text{Reject the lot} \mid p_0 = 0.03) = 8\%$ (Producer's Risk)

- If $p_1 = 0.15$, $\beta = \Pr(\text{Accept the lot} \mid p_1 = 0.15) = 4\%$ (Consumer's Risk)

- **Producer's Risk**: The calculated producer's risk is 36.7%, which is significantly higher than the acceptable level of 8%. This means there is a high probability that a lot with an acceptable defect rate ($p_0 = 0.03$) will be incorrectly rejected, resulting in an unacceptably high risk for the producer.

- **Consumer's Risk**: The consumer's risk is 8.7%, which is close to the acceptable level of 4%. This indicates that the plan is nearly adequate in terms of the consumer's risk, but it is still slightly above the target.

- **Conclusion**: The acceptance sampling plan $(n, c) = (15, 0)$ is **not acceptable** because it does not adequately meet the producer's risk requirement. The producer's risk is too high, resulting in a high probability of rejecting acceptable lots. 

- **Recommendation**: Adjustments to the sampling plan are needed to better balance both the producer’s and consumer’s risk requirements. This may involve increasing the acceptance number $c$ or adjusting the sample size $n$.

# Multiple Sampling Plans  {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Multiple Sampling Plans

- A **multiple sampling plan** uses two or more stages of sampling.

- At each stage, decisions include:

    - Stopping and accepting the lot,
    - Stopping and rejecting the lot,
    - Continuing sampling.

- **Multiple sampling plans** can reduce total sample size while maintaining Type I and Type II error levels.

- **Stage 1**: 
  - Take an initial sample of $n_1$ items.
  - Find the number of defectives $x_1$ in this sample.
  - Decision criteria:
    - If $x_1 \leq c_1$: Accept the lot.
    - If $x_1 \geq c_2$: Reject the lot.
    - If $c_1 < x_1 < c_2$: Proceed to Stage 2.

- **Stage 2**:
  - Take an additional sample of $n_2$ items.
  - Find the number of defectives $x_2$ in this second sample.
  - Decision criteria:
    - If $x_1 + x_2 \leq c_3$: Accept the lot.
    - If $x_1 + x_2 > c_3$: Reject the lot.

- **Acceptance Criteria**: The lot is accepted if the defectives in Stage 1 are within $c_1$, or if the combined defectives in both stages are within $c_3$.
  
- **Rejection Criteria**: The lot is rejected if the defectives in Stage 1 exceed $c_2$, or if the combined defectives in both stages exceed $c_3$.

::: nonincremental

Some key takeaways from this session:

- **Importance of Quality Control**: Quality control is essential for ensuring products meet customer expectations and can enhance a company’s competitiveness. Tools like control charts, SPC, and acceptance sampling are critical.

- **Statistical Process Control (SPC)**: SPC uses control charts to monitor and maintain process stability by identifying common and assignable causes of variation.

- **Control Charts**: Used to monitor different quality metrics, such as the mean ($\bar{X}$), variability (R-chart), and defect proportion (p-chart). Control limits are established to detect out-of-control conditions and require adjustments only for assignable causes.

- **Acceptance Sampling**: Provides a practical method for lot quality decisions without inspecting every item. It balances producer's and consumer's risks by setting limits on acceptable defect rates.

- **Multiple Sampling Plans**: These plans, including the two-stage acceptance sampling plan, can minimize sample size while maintaining error controls, improving efficiency over single-stage plans.
