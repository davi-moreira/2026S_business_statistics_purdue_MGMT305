# Experimental Design {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Experimental Design

<br>

-   Statistical studies can be classified as being either experimental or observational.
-   In an **experimental study**, the levels of one or more factors are controlled so that data can be obtained about how the factors influence the response variables of interest.
    -   **Cause-and-effect relationships** are easier to establish in experimental studies.
    -   **Analysis of variance (ANOVA)** can be used to analyze the data obtained from experimental studies.
-   In an **observational study**, no attempt is made to control levels of the factors.

## Experimental Design - Example: Chemitech Experiment

<br>

**Chemitech** developed a new filtration system for municipal water supplies. There are different methods that can be used to assemble the system.

**Chemitech** has narrowed down to three methods: A, B, and C and wants to determine which assembly method can produce the greatest **mean** number of filtration systems per week.

## Experimental Design - Example: Chemitech Experiment

<br>

**Randomization and Replications**

For the purpose, the company randomly selected 15 workers and randomly divided them into 3 groups, and then randomly assigned one of the three treatments to each group 5 of the workers.

| Factor                   | Assembly method          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Treatments/Levels/Values | A, B, and C              |
| Response                 | Number of units produced |
| Experimental units       | Employees                |

## Experimental Design - Example: Chemitech Experiment

<br>

**Terminology**

-   A **factor** is a variable that the experimenter has selected for investigation.
-   A **treatment** is a level (value) of a factor.
-   **Response** or performance variable is a dependent/outcome variable affected by the factor.
-   **Experimental units** are the objects of interest in the experiment.
-   A **completely randomized design** is an experimental design in which the treatments are randomly assigned to the experimental units.

## Experimental Design - Example: Chemitech Experiment

<br>

::: nonincremental
-   **One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** can be used to test for the equality of means (mean responses) of two or more normal populations.

<br>

-   The hypotheses:

    $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = ... = \mu_k$

    $H_a:$ Not all population means are equal.

<br> where,

$(\mu_1, \mu_2, \mu_3, ..., \mu_k$ are mean responses for the $k$ populations.)

$(k = 3$ for the motivating example.)
:::

## Experimental Design - Example: Chemitech Experiment

<br>

-   If $H_0$ is rejected, we cannot conclude that **all** population means are different.

<br>

-   Rejecting $H_0$ means that at least two population means have different values, or not all means are equal.

# One-way ANOVA {background-color="#cfb991"}

## One-way ANOVA: Model Assumptions

<br>

For each population:

-   The response variable is normally distributed.

-   The mean of $i$-th population is $\mu_i$.

-   The variance of the response variable is the same for **all** of the populations; denoted $\sigma^2$ (unknown).

-   The observations must be independent.

## One-way ANOVA: Analysis Method

<br>

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/analysis_method_anova.png") 
```

<br>

If the variation of the sample means is large, then not all population means are equal.

<br>

<br>

## One-way ANOVA: Analysis Method

<br>

There are two types of variation:

-   **Between-treatments variation** of sample means ($\bar{x}_j$): Variation due to different treatments. (Explained variation)

-   **Within-treatments variation** of observations from their respective treatment means (Unexplained variation).

<br>

-   The **F Test** for $H_0$ vs $H_a$:

    -   If Between-treatments variation is significantly larger than the Within-treatment variation, reject $H_0$.

## One-way ANOVA: Explained Between-Treatments Variation (MSTR)

<br>

::: nonincremental
-   The variation in the sample means is measured by the mean square due to treatments and is denoted by **MSTR**.

$$
\text{MSTR} = \frac{\text{Sum of squares due to treatments (SSTR)}}{\text{Degrees of freedom of SSTR}} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^k n_j(\bar{x}_j - \bar{x})^2}{k - 1}
$$

$$
= \frac{5(62 - 60)^2 + 5(66 - 60)^2 + 5(52 - 60)^2}{3 - 1} = \frac{520}{2} = 260
$$
:::

## One-way ANOVA: Unexplained Within-Treatments Variation (MSE)

::: nonincremental
-   The variation of the sample observations within each sample is called the **mean square error (MSE)**.

-   A measure of sampling variation.

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{\text{Sum of squares due to unexplained error (SSE)}}{\text{Degrees of freedom of SSE}} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^k (n_j - 1) s_j^2}{n_T - k}
$$

$$
= \frac{(5-1)(27.5) + (5-1)(26.5) + (5-1)(31)}{15-3} = \frac{340}{12} = 28.33
$$

$(n_T = 15 \text{ is the total sample size.})$
:::

## One-way ANOVA: Test Statistic and Decision Rule

<br>

::: nonincremental
**Test statistic:**

-   If MSTR is large, we will reject $H_0$; but we need to take the sampling variation (MSE) into account.
-   F statistic: $F = \frac{MSTR}{MSE}$

**Decision rule:**

-   MSE is always a good estimate of the common population variance $\sigma^2$.
-   If $H_0$ is false (not all means are equal), MSTR overestimates $\sigma^2$ and is expected to be much larger than MSE.
-   Reject $H_0$ if $F = \frac{MSTR}{MSE}$ is too large.
:::

## One-way ANOVA: The F Test

::: nonincremental
-   The distribution of the test statistic:

$$
F = \frac{MSTR}{MSE}
$$

-   If the null hypothesis is true and the ANOVA assumptions are valid, the sampling distribution of the test statistic is an **F distribution** with $k-1$ (numerator) and $n_T - k$ (denominator) degrees of freedom.

<br>

-   **Decision Rule:** Reject $H_0$ if the observed $F > F_{\alpha, k-1, n_T-k}$ (right-tail),

where $F_{\alpha, k-1, n_T-k} = \text{F.INV}(1-\alpha, k-1, n_T-k)$.
:::

## One-way ANOVA: The F Test

<br>

::: nonincremental
```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/anova_mstr_mse.png") 
```

-   Observed F-ratio = 9.18
-   `p-value = 1–F.DIST(9.18,2,12,TRUE)` $\approx$ `0.004`
:::

<br> <br>

## One-way ANOVA: Decision Rules

<br>

::: nonincremental
-   **p-value approach:** Reject $H_0$ if $p$-value $\leq \alpha$

<br>

-   **Critical-value approach:** Reject $H_0$ if $F \geq F_{\alpha}$

where the critical value $F_{\alpha}$ is based on an **F distribution** with $k-1$ numerator d.f. and $n_T - k$ denominator d.f.

-   In our example, $F_{0.05,2,12} = \text{F.inv}(0.95,2,12) = 3.89$, and $9.18 > 3.89$.

**Conclusion:** *We have statistically significant evidence that at least one pair of the assembly methods produced different mean numbers of filtration systems per week. The significance level is 5%.*

## One-way ANOVA: ANOVA Table

<br>

-   ANOVA can be viewed as the process of partitioning the total sum of squares and the degrees of freedom into their corresponding sources: treatments and error.

-   Dividing the sum of squares by the appropriate degrees of freedom provides the variance estimates, the $F$ value, and the $p$-value used to test the hypothesis of equal population means.

## One-way ANOVA: ANOVA Table

<br>

::: nonincremental
-   Assuming $H_0$ is true, the entire data set is basically one sample from one population, the formula for computing the total sum of squares (SST) is:

$$
\text{SST} = \sum_{j=1}^k \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (x_{ij} - \bar{x})^2 = (n_T - 1) s_x^2 = 860
$$

$$
= \text{SSTR} + \text{SSE} = 520 + 340
$$

-   SST has $n_T - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14 (= 2 + 12)$ degrees of freedom.

# Summary

## Summary

::: nonincremental
Some key takeaways from this session:

-   **Experimental Design**: allow for control over variables, enabling the establishment of cause-and-effect relationships.

    -   Observational studies do not control variables, limiting conclusions about causality.

-   **ANOVA**: Is a statistical method used to test for differences in means across multiple groups.

    -   It partitions the variance into components due to treatments and error, facilitating hypothesis testing.

-   **ANOVA Assumptions and Decision Making**:

    -   Assumptions include normal distribution, equal variances, and independence of observations.
    -   Decision rules are based on comparing the calculated F-statistic to a critical value **or** p-value to accept or reject the null hypothesis.
