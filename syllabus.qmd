## Course Description and Objectives

This course is designed to introduce students to basic data analysis techniques, including applications of probability distributions (normal, (t), binomial), sampling distributions, basic statistical inference methods, analysis of variance, applied linear regression techniques, logistic regression, time series analysis, statistical quality control, and decision analysis.

Our primary goal is to instill in students the quantitative and data analysis skills essential in modern business, where Business Analytics and Data Science are increasingly important. These skills will empower managers to make data-based decisions, perform risk assessments, develop policies, and collaborate effectively with analytics teams to boost business performance.

Because modern data analysis relies heavily on computers and software, we will emphasize practical applications using Microsoft Excel (with exposure to Minitab, R, or Python when relevant).

## Assessments and Grading

In compliance with the Business School’s Official Grading Policy for MGMT 30500, the overall class GPA cannot exceed 3.0. Final letter grades will be based on a curved distribution of final course percentages. While Brightspace will display your final percentage performance, specific grade thresholds will not be released prior to official submission.

Below are the grading components and their respective weights:

| **Assessment**               | **Weight** |
|------------------------------|:----------:|
| **Attendance**               |     1%     |
| **Participation**            |     4%     |
| **Homework** (8 total)       |    24%     |
| **Quizzes** (3 total)        |    21%     |
| **Midterms** (2 total)       |    30%     |
| **Final** (cumulative)       |    20%     |


### Attendance 

Attendance is essential for success in this course. If you do not attend class regularly, you are unlikely to succeed. According to the [University regulations](https://catalog.purdue.edu/content.php?catoid=15&navoid=18634#classes), “Scheduled courses allow students to avoid conflicts and reflect the University’s expectation that students should be present for every meeting of a class/laboratory for which they are registered.” Attendance will be recorded using iClicker, and these records will be reflected in your gradebook at the end of the semester. A minimum attendance rate of 85% is required to meet the expectations of this course.

### Participation 

During the semester you will be required to take participatory activities. Your participation grade will be based on this record. 

### Homework

-   **Eight** homework assignments; **none** are dropped.\
-   Homework must be submitted on Brightspace by the deadline in a **single** PDF or Word file, with all relevant Excel (or other) outputs included and clearly referenced.\
-   Submissions:
    -   You have 2 attempts to upload your assignment; only the second is graded if you use both attempts.\
    -   No late homework or email submissions are accepted.\
-   You may discuss homework with classmates, but copying or duplicate submissions are considered cheating.

### Quizzes

-   Three quizzes, each worth 5%. Quizzes 2 and 3 are not cumulative.\
-   Make-up quizzes are only allowed under **exceptional circumstances** (e.g., verifiable medical emergencies, conflicting NCAA events).

### Midterms

-   **Two** in-person midterms exams, each worth 15%. Neither is cumulative.\
-   Exams test technical calculation skills and conceptual understanding similar to homework problems.\
-   Calculators without internet or USB capabilities are allowed; phones/watches are not.

### Final

-   **Cumulative** in-person exam.\
-   Bring an approved calculator as described above.

## Grade Challenges

Grades and solutions will be posted soon after each assignment deadline. Students have **7 calendar days** from the grade posting to submit any challenge (3 days for the final two quizzes and homework assignments). Challenges must be based on legitimate discrepancies regarding data mining principles or grading accuracy.

1.  **Review posted solutions** thoroughly.\
2.  If you suspect an error, email Dr. Moreira with:
    -   Course name, section, and lecture day/time\
    -   Your name and Student ID\
    -   Assignment/Exam Title or Number\
    -   Specific deduction questioned\
    -   Clear rationale referencing solutions or rubrics

> *No grades will be discussed in-class. Please use office hours for clarifications. After the 7-day (or 3-day) window, grades are final.*
