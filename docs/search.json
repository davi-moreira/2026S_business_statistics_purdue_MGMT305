Coverage includes the application of probability distributions (normal, \\(t\\), binomial), sampling distributions, basic statistical inference methods, analysis of variance, applied linear regression techniques, logistic regression, time series analysis, statistical quality control, and decision analysis.\nOur main goal is to instill the basic quantitative and data analysis skills needed by managers in modern business, where Business Analytics and Data Science have become essential. These skills will aid in data-driven decision-making, risk assessments, and policy formulation, and will enable managers to collaborate effectively with data analysis teams to enhance business performance.\nSince modern data analysis is primarily performed using computers and various sophisticated software, this course will also emphasize software applications (such as Minitab, R, or Python). However, Microsoft Excel is the primary software tool demonstrated in this course.\nCourse Website: https://davi-moreira.github.io/2025S_business_statistics_purdue_MGMT305/\n\n\nInstructor: Professor Davi Moreira\n\nEmail: dmoreira@purdue.edu\nVirtual Office hours: Zoom link in your Course Brightspace Page\nIndividual Appointments: Book time with me through the link in the course syllabus on your Course Brightspace Page or by appointment.\n\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the basic statistical principles and their applications in the area of management and business.\n\nUnderstand fundamental issues in business and management.\n\nDescribe and use the commonly used statistical techniques for analyzing business data.\n\nUnderstand the impacts of recent developments in big data and AI in business and management.\n\nBe proficient in using Excel to carry out statistical and analytics methods covered in the course.\n\n\n\nPrerequisite\n\nSTAT 30301: Probability and Statistics for Business.\n\n\n\nCourse Materials\n\nTextbook:\nAnderson, Sweeney, Williams, Camn, Cochran, Fry, and Ohlmann.\nModern Business Statistics with Microsoft Excel, 7th Edition, 2020, Cengage Learning, Inc.\n(Required; also used in STAT 30301)\nHandouts:\nLecture Slides and Supplementary Materials (available on Brightspace).\nThe E-Book and handouts are located in Brightspace → Content → Table of Contents → …\nComputing:\nQuizzes will be administered in-person, and you will need to work on practice exercises in class.

This means there is a high probability that a lot with an acceptable defect rate (\\(p_0 = 0.03\\)) will be incorrectly rejected, resulting in an unacceptably high risk for the producer.\nConsumer’s Risk: The consumer’s risk is 8.7%, which is close to the acceptable level of 4%. This indicates that the plan is nearly adequate in terms of the consumer’s risk, but it is still slightly above the target.\nConclusion: The acceptance sampling plan \\((n, c) = (15, 0)\\) is not acceptable because it does not adequately meet the producer’s risk requirement. The producer’s risk is too high, resulting in a high probability of rejecting acceptable lots.\nRecommendation: Adjustments to the sampling plan are needed to better balance both the producer’s and consumer’s risk requirements. This may involve increasing the acceptance number \\(c\\) or adjusting the sample size \\(n\\)."

Tools like control charts, SPC, and acceptance sampling are critical.\nStatistical Process Control (SPC): SPC uses control charts to monitor and maintain process stability by identifying common and assignable causes of variation.\nControl Charts: Used to monitor different quality metrics, such as the mean (\\(\\bar{X}\\)), variability (R-chart), and defect proportion (p-chart). Control limits are established to detect out-of-control conditions and require adjustments only for assignable causes.\nAcceptance Sampling: Provides a practical method for lot quality decisions without inspecting every item. It balances producer’s and consumer’s risks by setting limits on acceptable defect rates.\nMultiple Sampling Plans: These plans, including the two-stage acceptance sampling plan, can minimize sample size while maintaining error controls, improving efficiency over single-stage plans."

It includes methods like interval estimation and hypothesis testing to draw conclusions with a certain level of confidence.\nCentral Limit Theorem:\nStates that the distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the population’s distribution. This theorem underpins many inferential statistics techniques.\nInterval Estimation:\nProvides a range of values (confidence interval) for an unknown population parameter, giving an estimate along with an associated margin of error to quantify the uncertainty."

This is common in practical applications where the sample standard deviation serves as an estimate for the population standard deviation.\nPopulation Proportion:\nInvolves estimating the proportion of a population that possesses a certain characteristic.

The required sample size can be calculated based on desired margin of error, confidence level, and variability in the population."
